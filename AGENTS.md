# Frontend agent guidance

This is the mobile-first React client for the Quintyne Realty inc FastAPI service. The primary users work from phones while travelling or on job sites. Desktop support remains important, but phone usability takes precedence.

## Stack and commands

- React 18 with Vite.
- API wrapper: `src/api.js`.
- Main interface and workflows: `src/App.jsx`.
- Shared responsive styling: `src/index.css`.
- Development server: `npm run dev` on port 5174.
- Required verification: `npm run build`.

## Mobile requirements

- Design and review at approximately 360×800 and 390×844 before considering a feature complete.
- Keep the fixed mobile header and five-item bottom navigation usable with one hand.
- Put frequent actions such as receipt scanning and RFI capture near the bottom-right thumb area.
- Respect `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` for bottom navigation, sticky actions, and full-screen dialogs.
- Interactive controls must be at least 44×44 CSS pixels; primary form controls should be about 48 pixels high.
- Form input text must remain at least 16px on mobile to prevent automatic browser zoom.
- Do not rely on hover, right-click, or drag-only interactions.
- Avoid horizontal scrolling except for legacy data tables where a card layout is impractical.
- Keep mobile forms full-screen and place their primary action in a sticky footer.
- Preserve keyboard access, visible labels, useful `aria-label` values, and adequate contrast.
- Test long filenames, long vendor names, empty states, loading states, errors, and slow uploads.

## Receipt and RFI capture

- Preserve `accept="image/jpeg,image/png,image/webp,application/pdf"` and `capture="environment"` on the upload input.
- File selection must call `/receipts/preview` and show the original image alongside editable OCR output before final upload.
- Vendor, amount, category, date, transaction type, OCR text, and job/quote/estimate reference must remain correctable.
- Never save automatically after OCR. Require an explicit “Confirm & upload” action.
- Disable confirmation while OCR or upload processing is active and show a clear progress state.
- RFIs are documents, not financial transactions, and must not appear in profit/loss totals.
- Maintain a usable manual-entry path when OCR finds nothing or the user uploads a PDF.

## API conventions

- Use the `api()` helper rather than direct `fetch` calls.
- Keep `credentials: "include"` behavior and CSRF handling intact.
- Display backend `detail` messages in a user-readable notice.
- Gate controls with the corresponding permissions rather than only hiding navigation.
- The default API is `http://localhost:8002`, configurable with `VITE_API_URL`.

## Change discipline

- Reuse existing components and visual tokens before adding a dependency.
- Keep desktop navigation and mobile bottom navigation synchronized when adding a view.
- Add mobile CSS in the existing `max-width: 700px` section unless a component requires a clearly scoped breakpoint.
- Do not remove phone safe-area rules, camera capture, OCR correction, or sticky form actions during refactors.
- Run the production build after every UI change.
